   Note: While the dot and circle are precise, the box might be less accurate

2. However, be strict about distinguishing between clearly different elements.
3. Position of target element description is not a strict criterion.

# Evaluation Process
1. Locate the click point with red markers.
2. Check the element name for useful info.
3. Compare the target description with your findings.
